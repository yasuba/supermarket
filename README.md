#Supermarket

This started as a thought experiment to practice OOP. We were asked to think about how we would code a supermarket system and how we would introduce special offers and discounts. What classes and methods would we need to create?

I created a basket, an item and a discount class. The basket (which is really more of a checkout), does most of the work - adding and removing items, keeping track of the price and adding discounts.

Not too pleased with the way I've dealt with discounts as it's not very flexible - only allowing for buy one get one free on apples and money off bulk buying bananas. This needs work.
