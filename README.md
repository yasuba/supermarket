#Supermarket

This started as a thought experiment to practice OOP. We were asked to think about how we would code a supermarket system and how we would introduce special offers and discounts. What classes and methods would we need to create?

I have pushed some tests and code for an item and basket and how they would interact with each other. I have yet to add the cash register, customer and promotions classes.
